00:00.000 --> 00:10.000
The sea and the jungle meet in an eternal embrace.

00:10.000 --> 00:20.000
The waves whisper stories the wind carries through the leaves.

00:20.000 --> 00:30.000
Every sound, every breeze, holds the voice of the living earth.

00:30.000 --> 00:40.000
Here, time dissolves, and only the present exists.

00:40.000 --> 00:50.000
Nature reminds us of what the heart sometimes forgets: peace.

00:50.000 --> 01:00.000
We are water, we are green, we are part of the same heartbeat.
